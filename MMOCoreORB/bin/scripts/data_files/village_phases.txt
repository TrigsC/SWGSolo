THE VILLAGE OF AURILIA

The Village of Aurilia (5306,-4145) is located about 6000 meters southeast of the Science Outpost on Dathomir. It is situated in a barren and desolate valley, and is surrounded by a thick "wall" of mist that only those with permission from the Old Man can enter (apparently he must like talking to the Sith Shadows too, j/k). The village itself is a rustic community of huts and simple (looking) villagers, with a stone wall surrounding its perimeter.

In actuality this seemingly plain village is populated with Force Sensitive "misfits". Every villager has some level of Force Sensitivity, which unfortunately brought undue attention to them in their lives prior to the village and, for some reason or another, forced them to seek a place where their gifts could be nurtured and expanded. Eventually these people found one another and decided to form a community where others in their situation could turn to, thus the Village of Aurilia was created.

Unfortunately, a wayward Dark Jedi named Mellichae has decided that destroying this village would be a good way to earn the Emperor's trust again and perhaps earn him a place at the Emperor's side. Therefore his soldiers, the Sith Shadows, are currently attacking the village through any means in order to try to destroy the village and everyone in it.

This is the point where you come into the village's story. The Sith Shadows will be attacking the village throughout four phases, during which time you can offer your service to various members of the village in order to try to help them out. Each phase is three weeks long (real-time) and you can take one quest from one of four villagers each phase. It takes a full 12 weeks for the all the phases to cycle.

The phases are:

Phase I:
The village has recently repealed a vicious attack by the enemy. Much of the village defenses have been eliminated, buildings are destroyed, and many people have been hurt or killed. At this stage, the village is preoccupied with picking up the pieces, healing the wounded, and determining the remaining strength of their enemy.
Phase II:
The village continues to build defenses. It is discovered that the enemy is regrouping. Another attack seems inevitable, and initiates who help can turn the tide.
Phase III:
In an effort to repeal another invasion, the village begins construction of a shield generator. Search and destroy operations are conducted to help keep the enemy at bay. The village continues to grow in size. It is now walled from the defense building of Phase II.
Phase IV:
The shield generator is complete. The village is at its maximum size. Despite this, the Sith Shadows will not give up. Throughout this phase, waves of the enemy appear in coordinated groups. This phase culminates with a final onslaught. Although the enemy is repealed, the village is all but destroyed. Return back to Phase I.
Main villagers:

Rohak
Phase: All
The village elder. Rohak was with the original group who founded Aurilia, and has been its spiritual guide ever since. He's very old and very wise...for a human. He will direct you to the various villagers giving quests during the phases. Also, if you somehow lose your Force Crystal he will give you a replacement.
Paemos
Phase: All
Paemos is a Rodian, and an expert with ranged weapons of all types. He is friendly to everyone, a trait that made him few friends on Rodia. He is much happier in the village and will give his life to defend it if need be. Paemos knows a thing or two about Force Sensitive skills and can show initiates the ropes of experience. He's the person you go to for transferring experience to Force Sensitive experience. Also, he will grant Hologrinders their free FS Branches and the experience necessary to purchase them (word of warning for hologrinders: only unlock and purchase one branch at a time, otherwise you will reach your cap and lose some of your free FS XP).
Noldan
Phase: All
Noldan is a Trandoshan and a master of melee combat. He is in love with Marite, believing his heart's secret is his own, but she is aware of his feelings and she reciprocates them. She won't act on her feelings though until she believes the village is safe from harm (how tragic that the village will never be safe). Noldan has been known to train outsiders who are working for the benefit of the village. He will teach you in the FS skill boxes that you have unlocked and have enough FS experience to purchase.
Marite
Phase: (removed from game?)
Marite is a female Trandoshan, outgoing and outspoken. She championed the idea of bringing in new people to train, hoping that it would start down the path of understanding for those who are force sensitive. On her homeworld, her own tribe disowned and cast her out because of her bizarre Force sensitive gifts. She is the village's ambassador to the outside world and has an amazing ability to heal.
Quharek
Phase: I, II, III
Quharek is a Mon Cal who has forsaken his own name for one given to him by the village. The villagers couldn't pronounce his given name. He's a craftsman and an expert on building, resource gathering. He is also adept at overseeing large construction projects.
Whip
Phase: I, II
Whip is a young human male whose reflexes are a sight to behold. He is definitely the best pilot in the village. He hates the Empire more than any of the others. He feels that if they hadn't outlawed pod-racing he would be a rich and famous racer, the best in the galaxy, and he resents the Empire because of this.
Captain Sarguillo
Phase: I, III, IV
Sarguillo is a Zabrak and is in charge of defending the village. His primary concern is keeping the village safe from harm in whatever way possible...
Sivarra Mecheaux
Phase: I, IV
She is a Human and the village's medic and is always looking for help curing the wounded or keeping the village's defenders healed.
Dageerin
Phase: II, III
An Aqualish male, he wants to delay the Sith Shadows from attacking the village so that they have time to repair the village’s defenses.
Eozlin
Phase: II, III
An Ithorian, his main responsibility is to find the resources necessary to rebuild the village’s defenses.
Chief Engineer of Aurilia
Phase: IV
The replacement for Aurilia’s Chief Engineer, this individual is under enormous pressure to repair the village’s Computers during the final big assault by the Sith Shadows. Unfortunately luck is not on the Chief’s side, as there seems to be a new one every day during the final phase...
