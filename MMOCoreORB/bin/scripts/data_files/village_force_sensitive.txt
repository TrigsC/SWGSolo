Force Sensitivity

You can determine how close you are to becoming eligible for a visit from the Old Man by using the /checkForceStatus command.

This will give you one of six possible messages:

1/6: "You feel no connection with the force."
2/6: "You barely notice something different about yourself."
3/6: "You feel a faint sense of the force."
4/6: "You feel the Force surge within you."
5/6: "You have a strong sense of the Force within you."
6/6: "You feel an inner glow. The Force is with you."
Once you gain the "You feel an inner glow. The Force is with you." status you will be eligible for a visit from the Old Man.

Note: There is a rumour that dying before you receive the visit can lower your level of Force Sensitivity, meaning you'll have to raise it back up in order to be eligible for a visit again. This has yet to be confirmed or proven wrong though.
