I can't guarantee the Imperial method, but I did the Rebel method with my 3-week-old Master Artisan/Master Smuggler (his only two badges) and was able to gain Force Sensitivity using it. The results should be the same with the Imperial path. [Update: The Imperial path has been confirmed to work.]

FYI, he started out with "You feel no connection with the force", got "You barely notice something different about yourself" at step 9, "You feel a faint sense of the force" at step 15, "You feel the Force surge within you" at step 19, and then finally "You feel an inner glow. The Force is with you" at step 20. It skipped "You have a strong sense of the Force within you" for some reason, but you can't argue with the results.

BTW, you could do the Corvette instead of the themeparks for content badges credit, but for the time it takes to get the tickets, buff everyone, and attempt to complete the Corvette it may almost be faster to just do the themeparks. However, if you have a few people trying to gain Force Sensitivity then the Corvette is probably faster (if you can all handle it or you have a good group that can).
