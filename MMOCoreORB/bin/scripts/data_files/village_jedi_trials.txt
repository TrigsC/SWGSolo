PADAWAN TRAILS

Introduction
Once you defeat Mellichae you will receive a waypoint to the nearest Force Shrine. Once there, you can meditate** in front of a Force Shrine to begin the Jedi Padawan Trials. The shrine will then give you various trials (random order), which you must complete. At the eighth trial you will become a Jedi Initiate and gain the ability to craft and use Lightsabers, which in fact will be your trial at that point. If you successfully complete all sixteen of the trials you will pass the trials and become a Jedi Padawan!

Be careful doing the trials, if you fail three trials you will lose all progress and have to start them over again from the beginning.

BTW, you can restart the current trial at any time by revisiting a Force Shrine. Also, if you so wish, you can restart the Padawan Trials all the way from the beginning as well.

**Note: In order to meditate in front of the shrine, kneel and select the "meditate" option from the shrine's radial menu. You do NOT need the TKA meditate skill!
